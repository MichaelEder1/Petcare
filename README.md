# Petcare

A Progressive Web App for the pet adoption of dogs and cats

Petcare is a PWA which was designed with the help of HTML/CSS (Tailwind)/JavaScript.
The PWA was built using the headless approach and consumes data for the animals, which is maintained in a WordPress instance and passed to the front end via an API.
